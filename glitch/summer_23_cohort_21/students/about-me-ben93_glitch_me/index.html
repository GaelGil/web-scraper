          My name is Benedicto Navarro or Ben for short. Born and raised in San
          Francisco, I am also a middle child of 4. As I work towards breaking
          into the tech field, my career job is to become a data analyst. While
          I'm not working on my professional growth, I enjoy exploring the city
          (on foot), binge watching tv shows and looking for new taquerias to
          try their burritos.

        I believe history is destined to repeat itself as I wanted to become a
        historian growing up. I got to incorporate that with data. My previous
        role as a supervisor for a snack startup, I was responsible for managing
        multiple snack budgets for our clients. I found myself struggling to
        stay under budget until I started to notice a trend: putting out less
        snacks gave me more flexibility within their budget. By putting out less
        of a certain snack, I was able to allocate that extra money into
        products the workers enjoyed more ex: Avocados.I continued this for
        months and noticed more people coming in early to grab their favorite
        snacks before they were gone for the day. Doing this, I was able to
        predict and even dictate eating habits. Also got kudos from office
        managers for encouraging workers to start their day early. This is what
        piqued my interest in becoming a data analyst. The trends, patterns and
        numbers all made sense to me and I know that I wanted to pursue a career
        in this field.
