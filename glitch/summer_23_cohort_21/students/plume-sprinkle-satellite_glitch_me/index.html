            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                In Karachi, Pakistan, I was born and raised, cherishing the culture and warmth of their homeland. In 2004, I migrated to San Francisco, California, embracing adventure.

Living in five different neighborhoods, I explored the city on a motorcycle and played sports passionately. I became a devoted fan of the local sports teams like warriors, giants, and 49ers.

                Initially working in construction, life took a turn when I got hit by a car. Determined to follow my passion for technology, I pursued a career in the field, building upon past IT experience.

Through challenges and triumphs, I emerged resilient and hopeful, holding dear the memories of their journey and looking ahead to a bright future in the city my home.
