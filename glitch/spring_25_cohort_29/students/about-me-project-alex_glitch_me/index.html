              I am passionate about music, photography, and the arts as a whole,
              I like going on hikes, playing guitar, singing, and playing games
              with friends, whether it be virtually and online, or more in
              person and analog with board games or table top RPG's. I am a
              representative of my campus' film club and work an on-call
              position at the Exploratorium where I facilitate private events
              paid for by companies and individuals alike.

            One work related experience I can think of is a time there was an
            error on a game, and because I was the only technician in that
            night, I had to troubleshoot (and hopefully fix the issue) by
            myself. It was an error with the display "right sensor/call tech"on
            a soccer game with a section at the back of it that housed all of
            it's balls. I started by checking the manual to see what the error
            meant, and I saw it meant that there was something blocking the
            sensor on the right side of the cabinet where the balls are held.
            The manual suggested that it was an issue of there being too many
            balls inside of the cabinet, therefore blocking the sensor, and to
            remove some to resolve the issue, I knew this wasn't the case though
            as I had checked how many balls were inside of it against how many
            were suggested and they matched up. After that I realized it could
            be anything blocking the sensor that could cause this issue, and
            decided to inspect it further, and after looking closer, I realized
            there was just too much dust and debris cover the sensor, and after
            cleaning it, the error cleared and it could be put back in
            operation.

            An education related experience I can think of is the time I had a
            business project with 5 of my classmates in our Creative Arts for
            Social Transformation (CAST) class where we had to practice
            teamworking, creative, and project management skills in order to
            create a final product we would all be satisfied with. We produced
            keychains, charms, and stickers, made visuals, a virtual storefront,
            and in the end made a business pitch to a group of educators at the
            SFMOMA. While business isn't something I was ever particularly
            interested in, I think it was a great learning experience and I'm
            greatful to have undergone it with my peers.
