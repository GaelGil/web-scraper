            Get To Know Me Professionally
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Zizo Ezzat and I am a student at San Francisco
            State University. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and
            building experience by joining a program called "<a href="https://devmission.org" target="_blank" alt="dev/Mission website">dev/Mission</a>". dev/Mission is working to bridge the gap between young people
            and technology by teaching me and other young people the skills that
            we need to be succesful. Skills that we are actively learning are:
            Coding (HTML, CSS, Java), circuit building and IoT, IT essentials,
            and networking. However, before I was in dev/Mission and even before
            the pandemic, I was not interested in tech at all. In high school, I
            never knew what I wanted to do but I always thought that Computer
            Science would be the last thing I would choose. Over the summer
            after my high school graduation, I decided to do a remote internship
            since the world was still locked down. I signed up for a program
            called "<a href="https://www.opps4allsf.org" target="_blank">Oppurtunities For All</a>", this program connected me to a coding internship called "<a href="https://www.codetenderloin.org" target="_blank">Code Tenderloin</a>". This is where my interest in technology began, they showed me
            basic coding and taught me network skills that I enjoyed so much
            that I ended up declaring my major as computer science that
            summer.<br>
            <strong class="fun">Skills:</strong>HTML, CSS, Java, customer
            service, proficiency in google products, data entry, filing, remote
            working and zoom experience. etc..
