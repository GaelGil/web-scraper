<!-- About Me Section -->
    
  <h1 id="#aboutmeTitle">About Me:</h1>
  <br>
  <p id="#aboutMe">I was born in San Francisco, CA on December 28, 2002. Growing up, I have always been intrested in art, music, videogames, tech, and soccer.  During my free time, I usually play videogames, draw or make music. My favorite hobbies though is art and music because I use it as a creative outlet and I am intrigued in the way these two can provoke heavy emotions in a person, but I also enjoy these hobbies because I believe it pushes me to challenge myself in order to improve.
    <br>
    <br>
    Since elementary school, I have been fortunate enough to be able to work with technology. Recently, I have taken an interest in more advanced stuff like cybersecurity, programming, IT, and IoT. My current goal is to be able to find a job that will test my newfound skills that I gained from DevMission and to improve on them.    </p>
