    Hello my name is Jaime and I am a third year student at SF State studying computer science (B.Sc). When I was younger
    I was always interested to see what direction technology was going in as well as what was possible and as a result I am one to embrace change. I
    am an eager learner and I'm always looking for new skills and hobbies to pick up. In my free time I am a collector as well 
    as a tinkerer (currently working a raspberryPi project!); I collect Funko Pops of my favorite characters from video games/movies/pop culture and 
    trading cards (mostly Pok√©mon). I've been living in San Francisco for about a year now and this city turned me into a cold weather kind of guy. 
    Currently, there is breakthrough technology such as Quantum computing and I am ecstatic to witness this new era we are about to see in tech with
    huge computational advancements and new discoveries pending in the next decade with quantum processors.
