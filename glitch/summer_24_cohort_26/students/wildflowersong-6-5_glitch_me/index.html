      Things fall apart and time breaks your heart<br>
      I wasn't there, but I know<br>
      She was your girl, you showed her the world<br>
      You fell out of love and you both let go <br>
        
      <br>
      <br>
      She was cryin' on my shoulder, all I could do was hold her <br>
      Only made us closer until July<br>
      Now I know that you love me, you don't need to remind me<br>
      I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I? <br>
      
      <br>
      <br>
          <b> CHORUS </b> <br>
          <br>
      But I see her in the back of my mind <br>
      All the time<br>
      Like a fever, like I'm burning alive<br>
      Like a sign<br>
          
      <br>
          
      
      <br>
      Did I cross the line? <br>
      Mm, mh<br>
      Well, good things don't last (good things don't last)<br>
      And life moves so fast (life moves so fast)<br>
      I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)<br>
      'Cause she couldn't be (she couldn't be)<br>
      More different from me (more different) <br>
      Happy and free (happy and free) in leather <br>
          <br>
      And I know that you love me (you love me) <br>
      You don't need to remind me (remind me)<br>
      Wanna put it all behind me, but baby<br>
