      BIO: hello everyone Hello everyone, my name is Juan. I'm from San
      Francisco, born in Vallejo and raised on 14th and Mission. Iâ€™m happy to be
      here today. For the past 5 years, I have been teaching math to young
      students going into high school and students going into the 8th grade at
      the AIM HIGH summer program. I enjoyed being a leader and using my strong
      communication skills with my students. Did Mission Bit for a few months
      and developed a small Dragon Ball Z game with my peers. Did photography
      for a year. My passion is baseball, I was a big critical thinker on and
      off the field helping the team in my league win the season. Now a CCSF
      student and on considering majoring in computer science and coding.
      Thinking of going into the tech medical field and hoping to work in one of
      the major hospitals in the area,
    </p>
