            Hi! My name is Carmen. I was born and raised in San Francisco,
            California. Iâ€™m currently 17 years old and a rising senior at
            Galileo High School. My journey in the tech industry began in the
            summer of 2020, when I took an Intro to Unity Game Design class at
            Mission Bit--a program that strives to provide free coding classes
            to underrepresented high school students in the Bay Area. From then
            on, I challenged myself to learn more about computer science through
            online courses and hackathons. This summer, I'm learning more about
            IoT, IT Essentials, coding (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and critical
            career skills in Dev/Mission to push myself further in this field.
            Furthermore, I will also be taking a class through Girls Who Code in
            August, and in my senior year of high school I intend to take AP
            Computer Science Principles as a way to develop my coding skills.
