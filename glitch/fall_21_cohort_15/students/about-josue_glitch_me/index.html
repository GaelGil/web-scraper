    <p>
      My name is Josue Hernandez and I am a sophomore at San Francisco State University. I am also a pre apprentice for Dev/Mission. My hobbies are working out, playing basketball, playing the piano and the drums. I love to go out to nature and just take it all in or go on hikes. I am a computer science major, so my background is mostly in Java.
